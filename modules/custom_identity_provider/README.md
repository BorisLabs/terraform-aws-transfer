# Terraform module _custom_identity_provider_

## Description
This module aims to setup everything required to support password authentication for a Transfer Family Server Endpoint.  
This is acheived through the use of a lambda as a custom identity provider.

This setup is heavily based upon the blog and CloudFormation template found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/enable-password-authentication-for-aws-transfer-for-sftp-using-aws-secrets-manager/)
